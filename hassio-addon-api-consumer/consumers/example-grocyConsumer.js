// One or more functions that fetch the data and post it to Home Assistant sensor(s) 
// This particular consumer was built because at the time the existing Grocy component you can get through Hacs didn't include a sensor for the Tasks entered in Grocy. It is obsolete nowadays.
// For now I've chosen to just map the Grocy api-calls one on one to three sensors. You could however also choose to combine the data first and then send only one data object to HA.

    // 2. Transform the data if needed
    // Because Axios does such a swell job at parsing json this will likely not be necessary. If the source api gives you too much info or a non-json response however, you'll probably need to do some magic here.


      // 3. Then post the data to Home Assistant
      // Because our response exceeds the 255 character limit for the sensor state, we set it as a sensor attribute. For the state I set the length of the data array, which will equal the number of tasks.
      // Each use case will have its own requirements, define the post body object as you see fit.

//CRON//

//Finally let's define how often the function(s) should be executed and thus the sensor updated
//To learn how to define your cron-job, have a look at https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron or use a generator like https://crontab-generator.org/

//The tasks sensor is refreshed every 30 minutes
cron.schedule('*/30 * * * *', () => {
  getTasks();
  console.log("getTasks cronjob executed at: " + new Date() );
});

//These two don't change very often, so I only have them updated once a day
cron.schedule('47 20 * * *', () => {
  getTaskCategories();
  getUsers();  
});
